# Transformer 

** Before beginning the project
1. First, import necessary data into the folder.
2. Second, alter the data files into usable forms of data. (ie. List of Sentences)
3. Thrid, make sure the tokens, vocabs, and sentences are pickled so resuming training can be faster. 
4. Fourth, write utility functions to make mask, embedding functions. 
5. Fifth, create the model with guarenteed functions to begin with in order to get guarenteed performance.
6. Sixth, write training functions/classes to smoothly train the model.
7. Seventh, write evaluating functions and trasnlating functions to measure the model's performance.
8. Eighth, Train and evaluate the model.
9. Nineth, change each parts of the model on your own code to make sure you understand the model well enough to conduct research.
